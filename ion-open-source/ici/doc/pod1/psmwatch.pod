=head1 NAME

psmwatch - PSM memory partition activity monitor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<psmwatch> I<shared_memory_key> I<memory_size> I<partition_name> I<interval> I<count> [ verbose ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For I<count> interations, B<psmwatch> sleeps I<interval> seconds and then
invokes the psm_print_trace() function (see psm(3)) to report on PSM dynamic
memory management activity in the PSM-managed shared memory partition
identified by I<shared_memory_key> during that interval.  If the optional
B<verbose> parameter is specified, the printed PSM activity trace will be
verbose as described in psm(3).

To prevent confusion, the specified I<memory_size> and I<partition_name> are
compared to those declared when this shared memory partition was initially
managed; if they don't match, B<psmwatch> immediately terminates.

If I<interval> is zero, B<psmwatch> merely prints a current usage summary
for the indicated shared-memory partition and terminates.

B<psmwatch> is helpful for detecting and diagnosing memory leaks.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

=over 4

=item 0

B<psmwatch> has terminated.

=back

=head1 FILES

No configuration files are needed.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

No environment variables apply.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

The following diagnostics may be issued to the B<ion.log> log file:

=over 4

=item Can't attach to psm.

ION system error.  One possible cause is that ION has not yet been
initialized on the local computer; run ionadmin(1) to correct this.

=item Can't start trace.

Insufficient ION working memory to contain trace information.  Reinitialize
ION with more memory.
