To build the ION system, build the subsystems in the following order:

1.	ici
2.	ltp
3.	dgr
4.	bp
5.	cfdp
6.	ams

Additional details are provided in the README.txt files in the root
directories of some of the subsystems.

Note that the ams subsystem requires that the "expat" library be installed.
Also note that all Makefiles are for gmake; on a freebsd platform, be sure
to install gmake before trying to build ION.
