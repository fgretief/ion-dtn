ionsecrc - ION security policy management commands file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ION security policy management commands are passed to B<ionsecadmin> either
in a file of text lines or interactively at B<ionsecadmin>'s command prompt
(:).  Commands are interpreted line-by line, with exactly one command per
line.  The formats and effects of the ION security policy management commands
are described below.

=head1 COMMANDS

=over 4

=item B<?>

The B<help> command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the B<h> command.

=item B<#>

Comment line.  Lines beginning with B<#> are not interpreted.

=item B<e> { 1 | 0 }

Echo control.  Setting echo to 1 causes all output printed by ionsecadmin to
be logged as well as sent to stdout.  Setting echo to 0 disables this behavior.

=item B<1>

The B<initialize> command.  Until this command is executed, the local ION
node has no security policy database and most I<ionsecadmin> commands will fail.

=item B<a key> I<key_name> I<file_name>

The B<add key> command.  This command adds a named key value to the
security policy database.  The content of I<file_name> is taken as the
value of the key.  Named keys can be referenced by other elements of the
security policy database.

=item B<c key> I<key_name> I<file_name>

The B<change key> command.  This command changes the value of the named
key, obtaining the new key value from the content of I<file_name>.

=item B<d key> I<key_name>

The B<delete key> command.  This command deletes the key identified by I<name>.

=item B<i key> I<key_name>

This command will print information about the named key, i.e., the length of
its current value.

=item B<l key>

This command lists all keys in the security policy database.

=item B<a babrxrule> I<eid_expr> I<ciphersuite_name> I<key_name>

The B<add babrxrule> command.  This command adds a rule specifying the
manner in which Bundle Authentication Block (BAB) validation will be applied
to all bundles received from any endpoint whose ID matches I<eid_expr>.
If the last character of I<eid_expr> is the wild-card character '*'
then a sending endpoint ID matches this EID expression when all
characters of I<eid_expr> prior to the last are equal to the corresponding
characters of that endpoint ID; otherwise the rule pertains only to bundles
whose sending EID is exactly equal to I<eid_expr>.

If I<ciphersuite_name> is a zero-length string ('') then BAB validation
is disabled for I<eid_expr>: all bundles from matching endpoints will be
immediately deemed authentic.  Otherwise, a bundle from a matching endpoint
will only be deemed authentic if it contains a BAB computed via the
ciphersuite named by I<ciphersuite_name> using a key value that is
identical to the current value of the key named I<key_name> in the
local security policy database.

=item B<c babrxrule> I<eid_expr> I<ciphersuite_name> I<key_name>

The B<change babrxrule> command.  This command changes the ciphersuite
name and/or key name for the BAB reception rule pertaining to I<eid_expr>.
Note that I<eid_expr> must exactly match the EID expression of the rule
that is to be modified, including any terminating wild-card character.

=item B<d babrxrule> I<eid_expr>

The B<delete babrxrule> command.  This command deletes the BAB reception
rule pertaining to I<eid_expr>.  Note that I<eid_expr> must exactly match
the EID expression of the rule that is to be deleted, including any
terminating wild-card character.

=item B<d babrxrule> I<eid_expr>

This command will print information (the ciphersuite and key names) about the
BAB reception rule pertaining to I<eid_expr>.

=item B<l babrxrule>

This command lists all BAB reception rules in the security policy database.

=item B<a babtxrule> I<eid_expr> I<ciphersuite_name> I<key_name>

The B<add babtxrule> command.  This command adds a rule specifying the
manner in which Bundle Authentication Block (BAB) production will be applied
to all bundles sent to any endpoint whose ID matches I<eid_expr>.
If the last character of I<eid_expr> is the wild-card character '*'
then a receiving endpoint ID matches this EID expression when all
characters of I<eid_expr> prior to the last are equal to the corresponding
characters of that endpoint ID; otherwise the rule pertains only to bundles
whose receiving EID is exactly equal to I<eid_expr>.

If I<ciphersuite_name> is a zero-length string ('') then BAB production
is disabled for I<eid_expr>: BABs will be omitted from all bundles sent to
matching endpoints.  Otherwise, each bundle sent to any matching endpoint
will contain a BAB computed via the ciphersuite named by I<ciphersuite_name>
using a key value that is identical to the current value of the key named
I<key_name> in the local security policy database.

=item B<c babtxrule> I<eid_expr> I<ciphersuite_name> I<key_name>

The B<change babtxrule> command.  This command changes the ciphersuite
name and/or key name for the BAB transmission rule pertaining to I<eid_expr>.
Note that I<eid_expr> must exactly match the EID expression of the rule
that is to be modified, including any terminating wild-card character.

=item B<d babtxrule> I<eid_expr>

The B<delete babtxrule> command.  This command deletes the BAB transmission
rule pertaining to I<eid_expr>.  Note that I<eid_expr> must exactly match
the EID expression of the rule that is to be deleted, including any
terminating wild-card character.

=item B<d babtxrule> I<eid_expr>

This command will print information (the ciphersuite and key names) about the
BAB transmission rule pertaining to I<eid_expr>.

=item B<l babtxrule>

This command lists all BAB transmission rules in the security policy database.

=item B<h>

The B<help> command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the B<?> command.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 4

=item a key BABKEY ./babkey.txt

Adds a new key named "BABKEY" whose value is the content of the file
"./babkey.txt".

=item a babrxrule ipn:19.* HMAC_SHA1 BABKEY

Adds a BAB reception rule requiring that all bundles received from
node number 19 contain Bundle Authentication Blocks computed via the
HMAC_SHA1 ciphersuite using a key value that is identical to the current
value of the key named "BABKEY" in the local security policy database.

=item c babrxrule ipn:19.* '' ''

Changes the a BAB reception rule pertaining to all bundles received from
node number 19.  BAB checking is disabled; these bundles will be
automatically deemed authentic.
