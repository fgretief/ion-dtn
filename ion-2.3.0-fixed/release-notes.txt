December 5, 2010

%%%%%%%%%%%
= GENERAL =

The ION (interplanetary overlay network) software is a suite of communication
protocol implementations designed to support mission operation communications
across an end-to-end interplanetary network, which might include on-board
(flight) subnets, in-situ planetary or lunar networks, proximity links, deep
space links, and terrestrial internets.  Included in the ION softwarex
distribution are the following packages:

- ici (interplanetary communication infrastructure), a set of libraries
  that provide flight-software-compatible support for functions on which
  the other packages rely, such as dynamic memory management, non-volatile
  storage management, and inter-task communication via shared memory.
  The ici libraries are designed to make the porting of IPN software to
  multiple operating systems - Linux, VxWorks, Solaris, etc. - as easy as
  possible. Ici now includes zco (zero-copy object), a library that 
  minimizes the copying of application data as it is encapsulated in 
  multiple layers of protocol structure while traversing the protocol
  stack.

- bp (bundle protocol), an implementation of the Delay-Tolerant
  Networking (DTN) architecture's Bundle Protocol.

- dgr (datagram retransmission), a UDP reliability system that
  implements congestion control and is designed for relatively high
  performance.

- ltp (licklider transmission protocol), a DTN convergence layer for
  reliable transmission over links characterized by long or highly
  variable delay.

- ams - an implementation of the CCSDS Asynchronous Message Service.

- cfdp - a class-1 (Unacknowledged) implementation of the CCSDS File
  Delivery Protocol.


Features included:

- cgr - Contract graph routing: a method of dynamic routing designed for
  space based applications of ION, but still usable for terrestrial
  applications. It computes routes using scheduled communication and deals
  with time-varying network topology.

- brs - Bundle relay service: provides interconnectivity between networks
  that do not allow servers (those behind NAT for example). For more
  information, check man brsscla and man brsccla.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
= NOTES ON RELEASE 2.3.0 =
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Modified administrative startup commands to block until startup is complete,
  rather than return immediately even if the node hasn't been fully initialized.

- Fixed a bug which truncated dtn-scheme bundle source EIDs.

- Modified some tests (1000.loopback) to run compiled objects instead of shell
  scripts.  This eliminates the need for shell scripting and allows automated
  tests to function on platforms without shell access.

- Combined similar test configurations to use the shared /configs directory.
  This will provide a standard set of updated configurations.

- Test suite has been modified to support multiple test sets.  Creating a
  text file in the tests directory containing a list of tests is all that
  is needed to create a test set.
  Examples: make test-all ; make test-branch ; make test-<anything>

- Added "limbo" queue to support suspension and resumption.  This allows the
  node to handle unexpected convergence layer failure as opposed to scheduled
  or static contact termination.

- Code scrub of DGR.

- Added bping, bpchat, and bpstats2 utilities.

- Custody transfer is now optional in both bptrace and bpsend.

- Added feature for "convergence-layer stewardship"; CL's can initiate
  reforwarding of bundles on transmission failure without explicit
  bundle-layer custodianship.

- Enhanced LTP's udplso with a transmission rate limiter.

- Added new AOS CLA for LTP.

- Bug fixes to: LTP, CGR, SDR mutex, bpcounter, ionscript, tcpcl, stcp,
  PSM mutex, SDR, bpsink, and others.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
= NOTES ON RELEASE 2.2.1 =
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Corrected bug in LTP's data acquisition into file-system storage.  Didn't
  handle data loss and retransmission properly.

- Fixed bugs in LTP session cancellation that caused slow storage leaks.

- Upgraded the LTP configuration spreadsheet and its documentation, to
  provide better guidance when most data are sent from or acquired into
  file system storage.

- Updated the Design and Operations Guide to document new features and
  API changes.

- Various other bug fixes and tweaks.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
= NOTES ON RELEASE 2.2.0 =
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Store bundles in ZCO.

- Added feature to store bundles directly to file-system memory, allowing
  much larger bundles to be handled by the node.

- Added feature to allow all stdout output to be redirected to log files.
  Feature is enabled by #defining FSWLOGGER.

- Code scrub BP, CFDP, ICI, LTP.

- Add support for asymmetric link-delay (range) in contacts.

- Add option to configure LTP spans for "purge" behavior on contact termination.

- Fixed handling of dtn:none eids.

  with dtn2.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
= NOTES ON RELEASE 2.0.0 =
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Based on JPL revision 255:6443ed8258e1

- Converted underlying version control system to Mercurial from Subversion.

- Add ionsecadmin for managing the security policy database.

- Added better support for cross-scheme routing.

- Add support for the previous-hop-node extension.

- Update route computation to current CBHE draft standard.

- Addresses memory leak problem identified by U. of Colorado in long-duration
  tests.

- LTP heavily modified to become more flexible and powerful.

- dtnadmin and associated utilities renamed to dtn2admin.

- Configuration file syntax changes slightly in ionadmin, bpadmin, ipnadmin,
  dtn2admin; heavily changes syntax of ltpadmin.  Included ION-LTP-Configuration
  document and spreadsheet to explain new syntax and calculate values.

- Bug fixes.

- Documentation updates.

- Various testing applications in earlier releases are split from the ion release.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
= NOTES ON RELEASE 1.1.0 =
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- Based on JPL revision 226.

- Experimental new tcp convergence layer compatible with the standard defined
  by draft-irtf-dtnrg-tcp-clayer-02.  This convergence layer is titled tcp,
  with other programs tcpcli tcpclo, and is suitable for connectivity with the
  DTN2 reference implementation.  Currently only unidirectional, unacknowledged
  communication is supported.  Some bugs still present.

- ION-specific tcp-based convergence layer is renamed stcp (stcpcli stcpclo)
  and still functions as expected.

- Adds user-contributed applications bping bping bpmon bpalive.

- some LTP related bugs are not yet squashed.

- Updates to various user-contrib programs; added a bpmon_query program to work
  with SNMP.

- Revise LTP to use randomly selected session numbers rather than recycling small
  session numbers - prevent data loss and corruption due to application of late-
  arriving segments to sessions that are re-using the session numbers of earlier
  sessions.

- added the bplive program.

- Updated for sbp_api.h and abp_api.c

- brought over basic working draft-tcpcl standards-compliant code with help of
  patch submitted by Andrew.Jenkins@colorado.edu

- manually applied patches from seb@highlab.com, adding sanity-checks and more
  consistent comment-line detection to the admin programs

- Add fixes to eliminate compiler warnings, per Ohio U.  Remove all ppc-vxworks
  makefile directories, replacing them with arch-vxworks5 directories because
  the VxWorks build varies with VxWorks version number and not with the hardware
  platform that you build for.  Add "expat", which is needed by AMS and is not
  provided with VxWorks.  Fix segfault bug in dtnfw reported by U. of Colorado.
  Fix bug in support for trackingElts list.

- applied the patch from Andrew.Jenkins@colorado.edu about dtnfw's rule/plan but

- added new ION.pdf to the in-development release

- overhauled ionstart, ionscript, ionstart.awk to account for the dtnadmin need for
  a node name as well as the bpadmin/dtnadmin/ipnadmin startup order bug found by
  Andrew.Jenkins@colorado.edu

- Revise routing to match applicable backlog (based on bundle's priority; not
  necessarily total backlog) against aggregate capacity when determining route
  viability.  (Per JIRA item DINET-107)  Add implementation of extension block
  for extended class of service, which includes an additional 256 "ordinal"
  priority sub-levels within priority 2.

- Upgrade AMS implementation to Red Book 2.

- Add interface for inserting BP extensions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
= NOTES ON RELEASE 0.2 =
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- The ion package, which implements the DTN Bundle Protocol (BP), has been
  upgraded to conform to BP version 5, submitted to IETF in December 2006.
  The changes are almost exclusively internal to the software and protocol:
  the format of bundles exchanged through the delay-tolerant network is altered,
  but the API for ION is mostly unchanged.  Note that this release of ION is
  not interoperable with implementations of BP version 4.

- The Remote AMS functionality of AMS has been upgraded to conform to the
  specification most recently posted to the public documents list of the CCSDS
  CWE site for AMS.  The API for AMS is unchanged.

- A variety of miscellaneous bugs have been fixed.
