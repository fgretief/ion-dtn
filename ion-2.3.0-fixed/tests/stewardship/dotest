# Tests bundle "stewardship", i.e., the bug fix that prevents deletion of
# a non-custodial bundle prior to convergence-layer notification that
# all transmission procedures for this bundle have been concluded, either
# successfully or unsuccessfully.  By transmitting a large volume of data
# at high speeds we swamp the receiving node's UDP buffer; the buffer
# congestion results in the loss of some subset of the data segments
# that were transmitted.  This transmission and data loss is cyclical for
# each block, and in some subset of the transmission sessions the number
# of iterations exceeds the retransmission request limit; at that point
# LTP at the receiver simply gives up and cancels those sessions.  The
# cancellation of a session at the receiver causes the sending LTP
# engine to signal convergence-layer transmission failure for all the
# bundles in that block, causing all those bundle to be reforwarded
# regardless of whether or not custody transfer was requested for them.
# We detect the reforwarding of these bundles by looking for '#' watch
# characters in stdout at the sender.
